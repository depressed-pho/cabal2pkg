* DONE [#A] =cabal2pkg update= should try to extract ChangeLog entries
* DONE [#A] Automate generating README.md; it is currently done manually
* DONE [#A] =HASKELL_UNRESTRICT_DEPENDENCIES= should only be generated to allow newer deps but not older ones
* DONE [#B] Allow wip packages to update
* DONE [#C] Can we somehow filter out duplicate dependencies listed in the same component? (pandoc-lua-marshal-0.3.0)
* TODO [#C] =cabal2pkg update=: Fall back to an older version if the latest one depends on a newer GHC
This feature is really nice to have, but it doesn't work out in the general
case. Consider the following scenario:
- Package foo-1.1 (the latest) depends on a newer GHC than what currently
  we have, so we fall back to foo-1.0.
- Package bar-2.1 (the latest) does not directly depend on a newer GHC, but
  does depend on foo-1.1.
In this case bar-2.1 is unusable too and must be fallen back. But how?

* TODO [#C] Better support for packages whose set of dependencies can only be determined with a SAT solver
This is a very hard problem. Some packages out there do something like
this:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell-cabal
  flag use-old-foo
    manual: False
    default: False

  library
    if flag(use-old-foo)
      build-depends:
        foo >= 1.0 && < 2.0
    else
      build-depends:
        foo          >= 2.0,
        supplemental >= 3.1
#+END_SRC

=cabal2pkg= currently warns about =foo= being too old, and that
=supplemental= cannot be found in pkgsrc.

[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install][cabal-install]] solves dependencies like this by first trying to use the
default value for =use-old-foo= (which is =False=). And if that's
unsatisfiable, it tries negating =use-old-foo=. It uses
[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install-solver][cabal-install-solver]] to perform a SAT solving.

But suppose =foo= comes from GHC itself, and the version we currently have
is =foo-1.5=. Also suppose we don't have =supplemental= in pkgsrc. In this
case we must do exactly the same thing as =cabal-install= and conclude that
it has to be solved by setting =use-old-foo= to =True=. Can we do that? In
this specific case, yes. It's definitely not easy at all though.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell-cabal
  flag use-old-foo
    manual: False
    default: False

  library
    if os(linux)
      build-depends:
        foo >= 1.0
    else
      if flag(use-old-foo)
        build-depends:
          foo >= 1.0 && < 2.0
      else
        build-depends:
          foo          >= 2.0,
          supplemental >= 3.1
#+END_SRC

But then what about this? =cabal-install= can solve this no problem because
it only needs to consider the current platform. In pkgsrc we cannot do
that. Our =foo-1.5= is fine for Linux but isn't for anything else. I really
don't know what to do about this.

* TODO [#C] Add support for configuration files
This is currently not possible because optparse-applicative can only read
options from command line (or really, a list of
=String=). [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/configuration-tools][configuration-tools]] is promising but it's not feature-complete
for cabal2pkg.

* TODO [#C] Spawn a background process that maintains a local copy of Hackage database
=cabal2pkg currently= performs an HTTP request to Hackage each time it
needs to query the database. This is not very efficient, especially when
there a lot of packages to update.

Ideally we should spawn a background process when we need to query the
database. The background process should:
- Maintain a local copy of Hackage DB using [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hackage-security][hackage-security]].
- Listen to requests (via a UNIX domain socket) from the main process,
  perhaps using [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/proto-lens][proto-lens]] and [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/proto-lens-protoc][proto-lens-protoc]].
- Shutdown when it's idle for like 10 minutes.
- Check for updates each time a query is performed.
- Query the HTTP API when the local copy is not ready, because downloading
  the copy takes time.
